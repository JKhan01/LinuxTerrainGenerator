# About Branch
>> The first stable release for Ubuntu-Linux which can be rendered only in **Gazebo Simulator**.

>> The entire development has been done on **Flask** Micro-Framework.

>> The script on getting the input autogenerates all the necessary files and finally all you have to do is :
>> 1. Launch gazebo simulator.
>> 2. Invoke the model from the list. It will have the same **model-name** as the *project name* provided by the end user on the *webpage* 

## Reference
>> The process of Digitally Elevated Model Generation in Linux using Gazebo came from **Github wiki page** [Creating Heightmaps from Gazebo][1] by [Prof. Catherine McGhan.][2]

## NOTE:
>> Efforts are under process to make the project a cross-platform product which can be rendered on a platform independant software. For updates, stay tuned.
