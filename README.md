# LinuxTerrainGenerator
>> A terrain or landscape generator is the virtual terrain model generated out of the satellite heightmap images available over the internet.

>> Right now, the development has been done on flask and with extensive use of ***os*** library commands which makes it **Linux** dependant.

>> The first stable release for linux is available on the Linux branch and it can be rendered only in the **Gazebo Simulator**.

## NOTE:
>> Efforts are under process to make the project a cross-platform product which can be rendered in a platform independant software. For updates, stay tuned.
